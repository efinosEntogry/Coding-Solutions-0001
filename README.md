Calendar Date Validator and Next Date Calculator

Write a program that:
• Prompts the user to enter a date (day, month, and year).
• Validates the date by checking:
  – The day is within the proper range for the given month.
  – Correct handling of February (including leap years).
  – The month is between 1 and 12.
• Uses functions to:
  – Validate the entered date.
  – Calculate the next date.
• Uses nested if-else conditions to handle the complexity of
  different month lengths and leap years.
• Uses a do-while loop to allow the user to validate and
  compute the next date repeatedly.
